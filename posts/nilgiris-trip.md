## The Plan and the Turn it Took

Some trips are purely functional: flights, meetings, return. And then there are journeys that manage to offer fresh moments worth remembering. My recent travel from Chandigarh to Ooty for official work was exactly that: familiar in outline, yet full of small details that made it special.

I had originally made a daring plan to make the entire journey by road in my own car, but the incessant rain in Western ghats meant I had to take to the skies for most of the journey. But as the thought refused to leave me, I saved the drive for the Nilgiris’ winding ascent from Coimbatore to Ooty, ditching the official vehicle at the Airport.

The route was all set: Chandigarh to Chennai, a short connecting flight to Coimbatore, and from there, a self-drive to Ooty in a red Honda Amaze.

I’ve driven through the Nilgiris before, but each time it feels different. The play of weather, the mood of the hills, and the stops along the way all combine to make each drive its own story.

## On the Road: Colours and Curves

The flight from Chandigarh to Chennai was long but downloaded content on my phone kept me engaged and two and half hours passed pretty quick. During the brief layover at Chennai Airport, I took the opportunity to review my notes for the conference sipping fresh lime soda at “The Irish House” before boarding the connecting flight to Coimbatore.

Upon landing, Coimbatore greeted me with its warmth. This was the first time ever I visited Coimbatore. On the way to Ooty, I could feel that the roads were busy but not hurried. One detail I always notice here, and did again this time, is the colour of the cars in this part: bold reds, cobalt blues, deep greens. They bring a vibrancy to the roads that I rarely see back home.

### Red and the bold

Watching them brought back the familiar thought: should I have opted for a bolder colour, like Lava Blue, for my car? Well, that seems to be a never-ending dilemma, and once a decision is made, it is made; you simply have to make peace with it.

There are 36 hairpin bends on the way from Coimbatore to Ooty. Having driven a car with a torque-converter automatic transmission lately, I was thrilled to take on these bends with a manual gearbox. The automatic can feel a bit dull, whereas with a manual you connect with the machine much more closely. But let’s keep that automatic vs. manual debate for another day! (I have although become an AT fan since I have shifted to one!)

## A Familiar Yet Comforting Stop

A little further up, hunger finally caught up with me. I stopped at a roadside restaurant, pleased to find North Indian dishes on the menu after a long morning without a proper meal. I ordered a paneer dish, expecting exactly what I knew, except for one detail that still makes me smile.

The food was served on a fresh banana leaf, known locally as *ilai thattu*, a tradition believed to enhance flavour and lend a sense of purity to the meal. I had eaten on a banana leaf before, but the familiar paneer paired with the gentle fragrance of the leaf gave the lunch a character that felt uniquely Nilgiri.

## Nilgiris Tea: From Disappointment to Delight

Halfway into the hills, I stopped at a small roadside tea stall for a much-needed cup of tea and a mandatory stretching break. The Nilgiris are renowned for their tea, celebrated for its originality and delicate aromas, and as a tea lover, I knew I could not pass up the chance to have it right here at the source. The lady at the stall prepared it with quiet efficiency, the steam curling up into the cool hill air.

### The “Kadak chai”

When she handed me the cup, I braced myself for disappointment as the pale colour was far from the deep, strong “kadak chai” I was accustomed to in the north. But the first sip was enough to undo that misconception. The tea was smooth, gently aromatic, and carried a subtle freshness. It was less about the punch of strength and more about the elegance of flavour. Without doubt, it will now find a place in my top five cups of chai of all time.

## First Glimpse of Ooty: Wrapped in Mist

The climb grew steeper, with a constant and gentle drizzle. Ooty revealed itself wrapped in a soft, shifting mist.

It’s a sight I’ve seen many times, yet it still has the power to slow everything down. The mist doesn’t just sit still, it moves with the town, slipping between rooftops, curling through gardens, and blurring the road ahead just enough to make the town feel unhurried and calm.

After reaching Ooty, I settled into the balcony of my hotel, letting the day’s travel fade into the background. From there, I watched the mist drift slowly across the hills, the movement so gentle it felt almost like watching time itself pass literally.

One difference I could clearly sense was that if you have braved the January cold of Shimla, even Ooty at its coldest will feel pleasantly mild. I sat there quietly for a long while, without any urge to check the clock, just letting the stillness of the evening sink in.

## Nilgiris and the Himalayas – Two Worlds Apart

Being from the region which is close to the mighty Himalayas, I can’t help but draw comparisons. The Himalayas are young fold mountains, about 50 million years old, steep, dramatic, still rising.

The Nilgiris, on the other hand, are far older—over 100 million years. They are block mountains, part of the ancient Western Ghats, with gentler heights and rounded contours shaped by time. Here, tea plantations ripple across the slopes. We might have known this difference for years, but the contrast will still feel vivid every time one travels between the two.

## Doddabetta Peak – Winds That Carry the Clouds

The next day in the evening visited the Doddabetta Peak. The wind was strong enough to make it feel like it was sweeping right through me. The clouds revealed sweeping views one moment and then closed in completely the next.

Unlike the sharp, distinct peaks of the Himalayas, Doddabetta is a gentle rise, the highest point here, but not in a dramatic, jagged way. One colleague, who had been especially enthusiastic about visiting Doddabetta Peak, looked around and asked, half-joking and half-serious: “But where exactly is the peak?” The question set off a round of laughter.

## Pykara Falls: Nature’s Own Masterpiece

The next morning was reserved for the Pykara falls. This would be my first visit to Pykara falls. Ruben, the local driver, was supposed to take us there. On the way, he became a friendly companion, thanks to his engaging conversations, helpful nature, and surprising taste in Tamil renditions of Hindi songs.

The water tumbled in clean, white ribbons framed by deep green, its sound a perfect blend of power and calm. Sat there for a while, letting the drizzle settle on shoulders, the air cool and fresh. From a small and rounded slope nearby, where a few empty benches faced the falls, Tamil music played softly through hidden speakers adding a gentle, almost cinematic touch to the moment.

Before heading back, Ruben took the way to a well-known restaurant where a hearty South Indian meal was served.

Later, he led to an authentic chocolate and tea shop called **Choco Story**, a chocolate museum cum store. The handmade chocolates were irresistible!

## The Return Home

On the way back from Ooty to Coimbatore, I found myself lost in thoughts, wondering when I would return, and when I might finally do that originally planned solo road trip from north to south. With all these questions swirling in my mind and A.R Rehman’s classics playing softly in the background, Coimbatore seemed to arrive sooner than expected.

**The Journey’s Quiet Lesson**

For a first visit, Ooty left a deeper mark than I had expected. Every part of the journey, driving through the winding Nilgiris roads, sipping tea in the drizzle, watching the mist transform the town, feeling the playful winds at Doddabetta, and sitting by the music-filled slopes near Pykara Falls, felt new yet instantly comforting.

And as I finish writing this blog from the balcony of a hotel room in a Himalayan hill station, I can’t help but be amazed at how different these two worlds are, each beautiful in its own way, each leaving its own imprint on the heart.
